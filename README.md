Okay, this shit seems super cool and amazing but it hasn't clicked in my brain. I took some time to research but honestly I am all in.

This reminds me of when I chose to rationale not learning noSQL because SQL is better. Once it hit my brain, I was like --

    "This is fucking awesome".

So I am going to try and create a database viewing application using Sqlite3, HTML, Go, Tailwind, and Templ.

First, Let's study this code and perhaps finish the video.

UPDATE: Ended up doing some cool stuff. Tailwind was added and I did some extra tidy up work. The database is interesting but Im gonna have to fuck with it.

# Section 2: Okay, so what the fuck is this?

Alright. On the airplane. Ready to study this thing. Let's see what we can find.

So whats up? Whats really good?

Let's get it. This is fucking sick. Vim + Tmux is AWESOME. We aint quitting.

Just implemented the hot reloading. Bash script is fucking awesome too.

The main thing to remember is keeping it super simple. Try to use as little dependencies as possible.

Vim + Tmux is fucking awesome.

Tailwind uses connection?

I need to code with no wifi enabled lol. This is kinda bullshit.

I want to have everything I need within one repo. Lets keep naming stuff differently but we need to go zero dependencies.
